# ToDo Application

This is a web application for keeping track of all your tasks. ToDo is intended to replace physically writing down tasks in notebooks or sticky notes. Since all your tasks will be saved on a server, you will always have access to them. With this in mind, the user interface is designed for all types of screens.

## Disclaimer

I am aware that I pushed my security constraints. I did this to demonstrate how I would create the file, as this isn't code that is in production.
